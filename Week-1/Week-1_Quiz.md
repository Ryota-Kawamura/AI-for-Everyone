You want to use supervised learning to build a speech recognition system. The figure above suggests that in order for a neural network (deep learning) to achieve the best performance, you would ideally use: (Select all that apply)
- [x] A large dataset (of audio files and the corresponding text transcript)
- [ ] A small dataset (of audio files and the corresponding text transcript)
- [x] A large neural network
- [ ] A small neural network

**4.** The only way to acquire data for a supervised learning algorithm is to manually label it. I.e., given the input A, to ask a human to provide B.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

**5.** Which of these statements regarding data acquisition do you agree with?
- [ ] It doesn’t help to give data to an AI team, because they can always produce whatever they need by themselves.
- [ ] Only structured data is valuable; AI cannot process unstructured data.
- [x] Some types of data are more valuable than others; working with an AI team can help you figure out what data to acquire.
- [ ] It doesn’t matter how data is acquired. The more data, the better.

**6.** You run a company that manufactures scooters. Which of the following are examples of unstructured data? (Select all that apply.)
- [x] Pictures of your scooters
- [ ] The maximum speed of each of your scooters
- [x] Audio files of the engine sound of your scooters
- [ ] The number of scooters sold per week over the past year

**7.** Suppose you run a website that sells cat food. Which of these might be a good result from a Data Science project? (Select all that apply.)
- [ ] A neural network that closely mimics how cats’ brains work.
- [ ] A large dataset of images labeled as “Cat” and “Not Cat”
- [x] Insights into how to market cat food more effectively, depending on the breed of cat.
- [x] A slide deck presenting a plan on how to modify pricing in order to improve sales.

**8.** Based on the terminology defined in Video 4, which of the following statements do you agree with? (Select all that apply.)
- [x] The terms “Deep learning” and “neural network” are used almost interchangeably.
- [ ] The terms “Machine learning” and “data science” are used almost interchangeably.
- [ ] AI is a type of deep learning. (I.e., all AI algorithms are deep learning algorithms.)
- [x] Deep learning is a type of machine learning.  (I.e., all deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms.)

**9.** Which of these do AI companies do well?
- [ ] Strategic data acquisition
- [ ] Invest in unified data warehouses
- [ ] Spot automation opportunities
- [x] All of the above

**10.** Say you want to input a picture of a person’s face (A), and output whether or not they are smiling (B). Because this is a task that most humans can do in less than 1 second, supervised learning can probably learn this A-to-B mapping.
- [x] True
- [ ] False
