# [AI for Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)
AI is not only for engineers. “AI for Everyone”, a non-technical course, will help you understand AI technologies and spot opportunities to apply AI to problems in your own organization. You will see examples of what today’s AI can – and cannot – do. Finally, you will understand how AI is impacting society and how to navigate through this technological change.

If you are a non-technical business professional, “AI for Everyone” will help you understand how to build a sustainable AI strategy. If you are a machine learning engineer or data scientist, this is the course to ask your manager, VP or CEO to take if you want them to understand what you can (and cannot!) do.
